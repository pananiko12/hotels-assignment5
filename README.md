This was our assignment to learn how to use javascript to make filters.
The data contains 4 hotels but they are enough to test how the filters work.
The select options are coming from the data, meaning that if you add a new hotel with a new type or  city it will show up on the selection options.

Every time a change is done in the filters, the filter function is called. There I empty the hotels list and I display all of them again and I test each hotel if they belong in the filtered options. It may not be the most efficient way but it was my first thought on how to do it.

Most of the data is synthetic so I wanted to add a random aspect on it, randomizing amount of reviews and the prices levels for 3 nights and the prizes from the different available sites.There was also some things I wanted to add more but weren't in the requirements and I didn't have time to complete, dates availability, the modal in view map option should have the locations of the hotels, the heart to add a hotel in favorites.

Here is a demo on how it works.
